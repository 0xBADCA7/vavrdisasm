Release 1.8 - 01/26/2011
 - Fixed address decoding for LDS, STS, JMP, and CALL instructions.
   Reversed the modification from release 1.7.
 - Added support for XCH, LAS, LAC, LAT instructions, bringing the disassembler
   up to date with AVR Instruction Set revision 0856I - 07/10.

Release 1.7 - 05/27/2010
 - Fixed address decoding for LDS, STS, JMP, and CALL instructions.
   Previously, vAVRdisasm was printing the disassembled address operands 
   as twice the value they should have been for these instructions.

Release 1.6 - 02/04/2010
 - Fixed the number-of-operands field for the SPM instruction. This bug was
   causing vAVRdisasm to crash as it was attempting to format a non-existing 
   operand during disassembly.
 - Updated the README.

Release 1.5 - 08/25/2009
 - Renamed source files to make more sense and for better organization of code.
 - avr_instructionset.c, avr_disasm.h, format.c:
	* Added support for DES, SPM #2, LDS (16-bit), and STS (16-bit)
	  instructions, bringing the disassembler to support the AVR instruction
	  set up to revision 0856H - 04/09.

Release 1.4 - 06/27/2009
 - file_disasm.c, libGIS:
	* Fixed handling of newlines (sometimes found at the end of program
	  files) so an "invalid record" error doesn't appear when a newline is
	  read.
	* CRITICAL FIX: Fixed reading and disassembly of odd byte length
	  records in Intel Hex and Motorola S-Record files. Special thanks to 
	  Ahmed for discovery and patch!

Release 1.3 - 01/08/2009
 - format_disasm.c
 	* Fixed a few small bugs/typos for cleaner compilation.
 - avr_disasm.c
 	* CRITICAL FIX: Corrected the absolute address calculation,
	  used in instructions like absolute jump.

Release 1.2 - 01/06/2007
 - format_disasm.c, format_disasm.h, ui_disasm.c:
	* Added formatting of data constants in different bases (hexadecimal, 
	  binary, decimal).
 - avr_instruction.c:
	* Fixed a small bug/typo: first operand of "out" instruction is
	  actually an I/O register.

Release 1.0 - 01/03/2007
	* Initial release.
